    "In practice you would want to try out different models and even revisit the data analysis to improve\n",
    "your model's performance. Maybe you can engineer better features, drop irrelevant or redundant ones, project your data onto a dimensional feature space, or impute missing values to be able to use more data. You can also try a larger set of parameters to define you search grid, or even engineer new features using cluster analysis. You can even include the clustering algorithm's hyperparameters in your search grid!\n",
